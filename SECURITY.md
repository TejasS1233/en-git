## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or potential vulnerability in **en-git**, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.  
Instead, report it privately using one of the methods below:

- 📧 **Email:** tsss1552@gmail.com (Repository Owner)  
- 🧑‍💻 Or directly message a maintainer via GitHub profile contact.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if applicable)  
- Possible impact and suggested fix (if known)

## 🕒 Response Time

We aim to respond to all security reports **within 48 hours** and provide a resolution or mitigation plan as soon as possible.

## ✅ Best Practices for Contributors

To keep this project secure:
- Avoid pushing any **API keys**, **tokens**, or **sensitive data** to the repository.  
- Always use **environment variables** for secrets.  
- Before raising a PR, run local security checks (e.g., `npm audit fix`).  
- Use updated dependencies — avoid known-vulnerable package versions.
